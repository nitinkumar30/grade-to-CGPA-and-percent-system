# Grading to Percent & CGPA system
**Conversion from Grading System to Percent. This is an approximate assumption as the grade system ranges the percent of an individual.**

# Introduction
**A normal grading system is something which is so confusing. We can't get the original marks/percentage of an individual, not even ours. So, I've made this simple project to convert that grade to appriximate percent & CGPA which is prevailing in our education system currently.**

GRADE ➡️ CGPA ➡️ PERCENTAGE

# Language
- Python

# Inspiration
Once me with my friend were walking down street, just an evening walk & suddenly we got through this that we've certificates which says we got A2 & B1 in such and such subjects but we don't know the marks or even percent we got. It needs to be shown to us atleast. Then I thought is this idea to convert this grade to percent. During the course of time, I've converted into CGPA also.
